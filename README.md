Basically, I had to implement an Assembly script that calculate based on a given vector and a given minimum length the smallest lexicographic permutation of
{1, ..., n}, where each element appears exactly 3 times, with a distance of at least m
elements between any two equal elements.

I also implemented this script with using of functions and backtracking programming method.
